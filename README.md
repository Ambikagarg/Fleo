First of all i have added the files in which I have written the code and I have added the screen shot of the website named as 'spacex.jpg'. Now giving a brief information how I have done it. I have displayed the different rockets as cards using bootstrap whose title is name of the rockets and which I accessed by rocket.mission_name because When I get the information of the given API then there is a mission_name in the information which I thought that it is the rocket name.then the information inside the card is accessed by rocket.details. I have styled by giving a background image of my choice and named the site "space encyclopedia".There is a dropdown which will ask us that we  want to filter by launching or landing whose API is also given.Similarily which we did above we will do here. This was my approach and how I made th website.
